# DataUseClub2024
This repository contains source code for the slides used in the [GBIF Data Use Club seminar](https://www.gbif.org/event/6Jx3bKshi8VWPqk2dW5Jz7/data-use-club-seminar-biosecurity-alerts) on 28 February 2024. The seminar was presented by [Callum Waite](https://github.com/cjwaite23), Erin Roger, and [Shandiya Balasubramaniam](https://github.com/shandiya). 

_Abstract_  
Early surveillance and incursion detection of invasive species is a crucial component of an effective biosecurity system. Australia is a global leader in biosecurity, having some of the worldâ€™s most stringent and recognisable biosecurity measures. Australia also has some of the most impactful introduced species worldwide due to a history of accidental and deliberate introductions. Here, we describe a prototype of a biosecurity alerts system developed in R by the Science and Decision Support Team at the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). We describe how the experimental R package, [{koel}](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/koel), ingests species lists, applies spatial, temporal, and taxonomic filters to occurrence records from the ALA, and emails users with information about species of concern.
